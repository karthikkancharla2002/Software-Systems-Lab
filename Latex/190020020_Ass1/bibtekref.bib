	abstract = "{There are only scarce data regarding the presentation, incidence, severity and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients undergoing long-term haemodialysis (HD). A prospective observational study was conducted in eight HD facilities in Alsace, France, to identify clinical characteristics of HD patients with COVID-19 and to assess the determinants of the risk of death.All HD patients tested positive for COVID-19 from 5 March to 28 April 2020 were included. Collected data included patient characteristics, clinical features at diagnosis, laboratory data, treatments and outcomes.Among 1346 HD patients, 123 tested positive for COVID-19. Patients had a median age of 77 years (interquartile range 66–83), with a high number of comorbidities (3.2 ± 1.6 per patient). Symptoms were compatible in 63\\% of patients. Asthenia (77\\%), diarrhoea (34\\%) and anorexia (32\\%) were frequent at diagnosis. The delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis, death or complete recovery was 2 (0–5), 7 (4–11) and 32 (26.5–35) days, respectively. Treatment, including lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids, was administered in 23\\% of patients. The median C-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphocyte count at diagnosis was 55 mg/L (IQR 25–106) and 690 Ly/µL (IQR 450–960), respectively. The case fatality rate was 24\\% and determinants associated with the risk of death were body temperature \\{hazard ratio [HR] 1.96 [95\\% confidence interval (CI) 1.11–3.44]; P = 0.02\\} and CRP at diagnosis [HR 1.01 (95\\% CI 1.005–1.017); P \\&lt; 0.0001].HD patients were found to be at high risk of developing COVID-19 and exhibited a high rate of mortality. While patients presented severe forms of the disease, they often displayed atypical symptoms, with the CRP level being highly associated with the risk of death.}",

	abstract = "{Our clinical practice is located in New York City (NYC), New York, the global epicenter of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). At the time of this writing in early July 2020, there have been over 222,000 cases and nearly 23,000 deaths in NYC in the 3 months ending in June 2020. As of early June 2020 we have managed 65 patients with IBD and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by PCR-RNA for the virus (48 patients), by positive IgG antibodies (17 patients), and by classic COVID-19 presentations. As of June 2020, the number of cases from this practice exceeds the number of cases reported from of any state outside of New York in the United States and exceeds the number of cases in 43 of the 47 countries reporting to the international SECURE-IBD registry of patients with IBD and SARS-CoV-2infection.1 In this article, we share our real-world experience in the care of this large cohort of patients, describe our practice’s approach, and offer suggestions to the practical care of the patient with IBD and COVID-19. We also hope to describe the sense of life in NYC at this uniquely tragic time. Through the month of June, NYC had successfully passed through “Phase 1 of reopening,” allowing most businesses to open with appropriate “social distance” and wearing of masks both indoors and outdoors. This followed a 3-month period of onerous and suffocating but effective shutdown of NYC. But by early July, some plans to further reopen NYC were abruptly halted by the recognition of major new outbreaks in states such as Arizona, Texas, and Florida, where statewide closings came too late and reopening occurred too early. This has led, almost predictably, to a foreboding spike in cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths into August 2020, in a pattern resembling the onset of the most ominous weeks in NYC in March, April and May. As the number of cases is now growing alarmingly throughout other areas of this country and around the world, we hope that sharing the lessons that we have learned to date will be of value to others.}",

	abstract = {Recent outbreaks of Ebola virus (EBOV) and SARS-CoV-2 have exposed our limited therapeutic options and poor understanding of cellular mechanisms that block viral infections. Using a transposon-mediated gene-activation screen in human cells, we identify that the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) has antiviral activity against EBOV. CIITA induces resistance by activating expression of the p41 isoform of invariant chain CD74, which inhibits viral entry by blocking cathepsin-mediated processing of the Ebola glycoprotein (EboGP). We further show that CD74 p41 can block the endosomal entry pathway of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. These data therefore implicate CIITA and CD74 in host defense against a range of viruses, and identify an additional function of these proteins beyond their canonical roles in antigen presentation.},
